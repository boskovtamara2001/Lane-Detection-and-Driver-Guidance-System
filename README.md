# Lane-Detection-and-Driver-Guidance-System
This project is part of the Multimedia Systems in the Automotive Industry course. It is a program designed to process video footage and images to detect white lane markings on the road. The program provides visual guidance to the driver by overlaying direction lines on the video, indicating the optimal path to stay within their lane.
